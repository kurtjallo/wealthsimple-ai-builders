## 2. Video Structure That Works

### The "Problem-Solution-Magic" Arc (2-3 Minutes)

This is the optimal structure for a technical project demo video:

```
[0:00-0:10]  HOOK — Grab attention (problem statement or surprising result)
[0:10-0:30]  CONTEXT — Who has this problem and why it matters
[0:30-0:45]  SOLUTION — What you built (one sentence)
[0:45-1:45]  DEMO — Show it working (the "magic moment")
[1:45-2:15]  TECHNICAL DEPTH — Brief peek under the hood
[2:15-2:30]  RESULTS — What it achieves / impact metrics
[2:30-2:45]  VISION — Where this could go
[2:45-3:00]  CTA — How to try it / next steps
```

### YC Demo Day 15-Slide Structure (Adapted for Video)

YC coaches every batch to follow this 120-second narrative arc:

1. **Title & One-Liner** (5s) — Company name + punchy value proposition
2. **Problem** (10s) — Define customer pain, quantify the cost
3. **Customer Quote** (5s) — Real testimonial showing actual pain
4. **Solution** (10s) — Single sentence product promise
5. **Demo** (15s) — Silent screen recording showing 3-step workflow
6. **Market Size** (10s) — TAM exceeding $1B
7. **Competition** (5s) — 2-axis positioning chart, you in top-right
8. **Why Now** (5s) — Secular tailwind or regulatory shift
9. **Traction** (10s) — Upward-trending chart
10. **Business Model** (5s) — ACV, margins, payback
11. **Go-to-Market** (5s) — Compounding flywheel
12. **Team** (5s) — One photo per founder + achievements
13. **Ask** (5s) — Specific amount tied to milestones
14. **Vision** (5s) — Ten-word world domination statement
15. **Thank-You** (5s) — QR code to calendar

The key principle: **"The format is the hook"** — it creates cognitive fluency so your story feels inevitable.

### For a "Build to Get Hired" Submission

Adapt the structure to emphasize builder credibility:

```
[0:00-0:10]  HOOK — Show the end result or a "wow" moment first
[0:10-0:25]  PROBLEM — What real user pain does this solve?
[0:25-0:40]  WHY THIS APPROACH — What insight did you have?
[0:40-1:30]  LIVE DEMO — Walk through the actual product working
[1:30-2:00]  TECHNICAL DECISIONS — Brief code/architecture peek
[2:00-2:20]  WHAT I LEARNED — Show growth mindset
[2:20-2:40]  WHAT'S NEXT — Vision for where this goes
[2:40-2:50]  ABOUT ME — Quick credibility (15 seconds max)
```

## 3. The First 10 Seconds — Hook Techniques

**By the 10-second mark, 20% of viewers have already left.** A strong hook retains 70% of viewers past 10 seconds; a weak one loses more than half.

### Proven Hook Types (Pick One)

1. **Show the End Result First**
   - "Watch me go from a blank screen to a fully functional AI financial advisor in 60 seconds."
   - Start with the most impressive output, then rewind to show how

2. **Jarring Statistic**
   - "The average person spends 40 hours a year manually categorizing transactions. I built something that does it in 3 seconds."

3. **Problem as a Question**
   - "What if your financial advisor could read every SEC filing in real-time?"
   - Questions force mental engagement

4. **Pattern Interrupt / Visual Novelty**
   - Open with an unexpected visual — the product doing something that looks almost magical
   - Screen Studio's auto-zoom naturally creates this effect

5. **Before/After Contrast**
   - Split screen: left side shows the painful old way, right side shows your solution

6. **Bold Claim**
   - "This is the best way to [do X] that I've ever seen — and I built it in a weekend."

### What NOT to Do in the First 10 Seconds
- Do not show a logo animation or title card (waste of precious seconds)
- Do not start with "Hi, my name is..." (save intros for later)
- Do not use generic stock footage
- Do not start with a long explanation of the problem before showing anything visual

---

## 4. Showing Code vs. UI — The Right Balance

### For a Technical Hiring Audience (like Wealthsimple)

**Show BOTH, but lead with the product experience:**

- **70% UI/Product demo** — Show the thing working, the user experience, the "magic moment"
- **20% Architecture/Code** — Brief peek at key technical decisions (3-5 seconds of code max at a time)
- **10% Terminal/Results** — Show it actually running, real data, real performance

### When to Show Code
- To demonstrate a clever algorithm or approach
- To show clean, well-structured code (signals engineering quality)
- To highlight AI/ML integration points
- To show testing or CI/CD (signals professional practices)

### When NOT to Show Code
- Generic boilerplate (React components, CRUD endpoints)
- Configuration files
- Import statements or package.json
- Anything that every developer writes the same way

### How to Show Code Effectively
- Use a large, readable font (16pt minimum, preferably 20pt+)
- Use a dark theme with syntax highlighting (VS Code Dark+ or similar)
- Highlight only the 5-10 lines that matter, not the entire file
- Use Screen Studio's auto-zoom to focus on the relevant section
- Show code for no more than 10-15 seconds at a time before cutting back to the UI

### What Developers Specifically Value
- Stick to familiar programming languages and realistic scenarios
- Code must feel real, not staged — developers spot fake scenarios instantly
- Show the Problem -> Solution -> Value flow through code
- Include real error handling, not just happy paths

---

## 5. Narration Best Practices

### Voice & Delivery
- **Pace**: 130-150 words per minute (normal conversation is ~150, slow down slightly)
- **Tone**: Conversational, not presentation-mode. Talk like you are explaining to a smart friend
- **Energy**: Enthusiastic but not over-the-top. Genuine excitement beats forced hype
- **Pauses**: Leave 1-2 second pauses between sections for the viewer to absorb

### Scripting Strategy
- Write a full script first, then practice until it sounds natural (not read)
- Target 130-150 words per minute of video
- For a 2.5-minute video, that is approximately 325-375 words total
- Break the script into chunks — record one capability at a time
- Use active verbs: "Click create, drag the widget, type your query" not "The user can click..."

### Language Rules
- Use "you" and "your" — speak directly to the viewer
- Avoid jargon unless your audience is exclusively technical
- Replace "This feature allows for the creation of..." with "You can create..."
- No filler words: "basically," "essentially," "sort of," "kind of"
- Do not say "as you can see" — if they can see it, you do not need to say it

### Audio Quality Tips
- Record in a quiet room (closets with clothes are great makeshift studios)
- Use an external microphone if possible (even a $30 USB mic is a huge upgrade)
- Keep consistent distance from the mic
- Record a "room tone" sample (10 seconds of silence) for noise reduction
- Use Audacity (free) or built-in tools for noise reduction in post

## 6. Pacing & Transitions

### Ideal Pacing Pattern

```
FAST  → Hook / Opening (high energy, quick cuts)
SLOW  → Problem explanation (let it sink in)
FAST  → Solution reveal (excitement)
MEDIUM → Demo walkthrough (clear but not dragging)
FAST  → Technical highlights (brief code flashes)
SLOW  → Results / Impact (let the numbers land)
FAST  → Vision / CTA (end on energy)
```

### Transition Techniques
- **Hard cuts** between sections (the default — clean and professional)
- **Zoom transitions** when moving between code and UI (Screen Studio handles this automatically)
- **Fade to black** only for major section changes (use sparingly)
- Do NOT use slide transitions, wipes, or spinning effects
- Let the cursor movement itself guide transitions when doing screen recordings

### Speed Controls
- Speed up repetitive actions (typing, loading) to 2-4x
- Slow down or pause on key moments (the "aha" reveal)
- Use jump cuts to remove dead time, "umms", and pauses
- Target no more than 5 seconds on any single static screen

## 7. Polished vs. Raw — What Works When

### The Answer: "Polished Casual" Wins for Submissions

Neither overly produced nor sloppy. The sweet spot:

| Aspect | Polished | Raw | "Polished Casual" (Target) |
|--------|----------|-----|---------------------------|
| Recording | Multi-camera, studio | Phone selfie | Screen Studio with webcam bubble |
| Editing | Motion graphics, transitions | Single take, no cuts | Clean cuts, zoom effects, no fancy transitions |
| Audio | Professional voiceover | Built-in laptop mic | External USB mic, natural voice |
| Script | Teleprompter, formal | Stream of consciousness | Scripted but delivered naturally |
| Mistakes | None | Many | Occasional small ones left in (authenticity) |

### Why "Polished Casual" Works for Hiring Submissions
- **Too polished** = looks like a marketing video, not a builder demo. Feels inauthentic.
- **Too raw** = looks unprofessional, suggests you do not care about quality
- **Polished casual** = "I am a competent builder who can communicate clearly and cares about quality"

### Platform-Specific Guidance
- **Portfolio submission / application**: Polished casual (this guide's target)
- **Twitter/X viral clip**: Can be rawer, focus on the "wow" moment, 30-60 seconds
- **Product Hunt**: Polished, silent-friendly, 15-45 seconds
- **LinkedIn**: More polished, professional tone

## 8. Lessons from Viral AI Tool Demos

### What Made Devin AI's Launch Go Viral (March 2024)
- **Bold claim**: "World's first fully autonomous AI Software Engineer"
- **Show, don't tell**: Showed Devin autonomously planning, cloning repos, writing code, debugging, testing, and deploying
- **Real-world task**: Completed actual Upwork freelance jobs — not toy examples
- **Length**: Short, focused clips on Twitter, longer walkthrough on YouTube

### What Makes AI Tool Demos Go Viral on Twitter/X
- **3-second hook rule**: Must grab attention before the scroll
- **Visual magic**: Show the AI doing something that looks almost impossible
- **Speed**: Compress a long task into 30-60 seconds
- **Relatable pain point**: "Remember spending hours doing X? Watch this..."
- **Before/after format**: Side-by-side showing the old way vs. the AI way
- **No music needed**: Screen recordings with text overlays work great
- **Thread format**: Post the short clip, then explain the technical details in the thread

### v0 by Vercel's Viral Strategy
- Showed prompt-to-UI generation in real-time
- Clean, minimal interface — the product spoke for itself
- Community-generated examples created organic virality

### Common Patterns Across Viral AI Demos
1. Open with the output (the impressive result)
2. Then show the simple input that created it
3. The gap between input simplicity and output impressiveness = the "wow"
4. Keep clips under 60 seconds for Twitter, 2-3 minutes for full demos

## 9. Product Hunt Launch Video Specifics

### Technical Specs
- **Duration**: 15-45 seconds (NOT 2-3 minutes)
- **Aspect ratio**: 1:1 (square) preferred for mobile feed
- **File size**: Under 30 MB
- **Format**: H.264 MP4, 24fps, 4Mbps bitrate
- **Resolution**: 1080x1080 for square

### Critical Rules
- **95% of Product Hunt users watch muted** — burned-in captions are mandatory
- Pick ONE core "wow moment" and build around it
- Write a 35-word script maximum
- Structure: Hook (3s) -> Demo (25s) -> Benefit (10s) -> CTA (5s)
- Products with videos see 12-18% higher upvote rates

### Product Hunt Video Template
1. **Plan** (15 min): Select one core wow-moment, compose 35-word script
2. **Script** (10 min): Hook -> demo -> benefit -> CTA
3. **Record** (30 min): Screen-record at 1080p, stationary cursor
4. **Edit** (45 min): Crop to 1:1, add text overlays, export H.264
5. **Caption**: Embed burned-in captions (22pt minimum font)
6. **Compress**: Target ~20 MB via HandBrake
7. **Upload**: Test on both desktop and mobile before launch

## 10. "Build to Get Hired" Submission Videos That Work

### What Hiring Managers Look For
- **Professional portfolio websites increase interview callbacks by 78%**
- Recruiters spend about 5 minutes per candidate — polished live demos and clear documentation are the primary filters
- 3-5 well-documented, complete projects beat 20 incomplete ones

### Elements of a Winning Submission Demo
1. **Show a REAL problem being solved** — not a toy/tutorial project
2. **Live, working demo** — deployed and accessible, not just code on GitHub
3. **Clear README that reads like a mini case study**: problem, architecture, challenges, impact
4. **Video demo** included alongside the code submission
5. **Measurable results** — "Reduced processing time by 80%" is better than "made it faster"

### What Differentiates Winners
- **Creativity in approach** — a unique angle on a common problem
- **End-to-end completion** — not just a proof of concept
- **Quality of communication** — the demo video itself shows communication skills
- **Technical depth without over-engineering** — clean, purposeful code
- **Growth mindset visible** — mention what you would improve, what you learned

### Portfolio Strategy
- Deploy live demos (Vercel, Railway, Fly.io)
- Pin your best 4-6 GitHub repos showcasing different skills
- Each project needs: live demo link, clear README, video walkthrough, architecture diagram
- Write blog posts about your technical decisions
