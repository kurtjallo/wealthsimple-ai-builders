## 3. Workflows Ripe for AI-Native Rebuilding

### 3.1 Account Onboarding & KYC (High Impact)
**Current state**: Multi-step KYC process with selfie + ID verification, Flinks bank connection, manual review bottlenecks.
**AI-native vision**: Conversational onboarding that explains each step, pre-fills information from connected sources, resolves verification issues in real-time, and sets up the right account types based on a natural language conversation about financial goals.

### 3.2 Investment Research & Decision Making (High Impact)
**Current state**: Basic quotes, no research tools, users must leave platform for analysis.
**AI-native vision**: Natural language queries like "Show me Canadian dividend ETFs with low MER that fit my TFSA" with AI that understands your portfolio, goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation to provide contextual recommendations.

### 3.3 Tax Filing & Optimization (High Impact)
**Current state**: Annual form-filling exercise with auto-import of slips.
**AI-native vision**: Year-round tax intelligence that proactively suggests tax-loss harvesting opportunities, RRSP contribution timing, TFSA optimization, income splitting strategies, and walks users through filing with natural language explanations of every deduction.

### 3.4 Portfolio Review & Rebalancing (Medium-High Impact)
**Current state**: Automated rebalancing on triggers (managed) or fully manual (self-directed).
**AI-native vision**: Continuous AI portfolio analyst that explains why your portfolio drifted, recommends actions in plain language, considers tax implications of rebalancing, and benchmarks against personalized alternatives.

### 3.5 Customer Support & Issue Resolution (High Impact)
**Current state**: Chatbot deflection -> long queue -> scripted human response.
**AI-native vision**: AI agent that has full context of account state, transaction history, and regulatory requirements. Can actually resolve issues (process transfers, explain freezes, initiate investigations) rather than just answer FAQs.

### 3.6 Financial Goal Planning & Tracking (High Impact)
**Current state**: Generic calculators disconnected from actual accounts.
**AI-native vision**: AI financial coach that connects all accounts, understands income patterns, tracks progress toward goals (home purchase via FHSA, retirement via RRSP, emergency fund), and proactively suggests course corrections.

### 3.7 Cross-Product Optimization (Medium Impact)
**Current state**: Products are siloed -- cash, investing, crypto, tax are separate experiences.
**AI-native vision**: Unified AI that understands your entire financial picture and suggests optimal allocation across products, e.g., "You have $5K idle in cash earning 1.25% -- want me to move $3K to your TFSA to invest in your growth portfolio?"

### 3.8 Fee & Tier Optimization (Medium Impact)
**Current state**: Users discover fees retroactively, tier benefits are opaque.
**AI-native vision**: AI that transparently tracks fee impact, proactively alerts when tier upgrades would save money, suggests strategies to minimize FX costs, and compares total cost of ownership against alternatives.

## 4. Wealthsimple's Current AI Efforts

### Internal Engineering
- GitHub Copilot used by 85% of developers
- Cursor code editor deployed to half the engineering team
- LLM Gateway serves 500 internal users daily
- AI used for database migrations and developer productivity

### Customer-Facing
- **Decagon chatbot** (replaced Ada in Jan 2025): handles 60-70% of queries
- **Willow AI Voice Agent**: phone-based AI support
- **AI research dashboard** (planned 2026): natural language stock lookup via Fey acquisition
- Philosophy: "Not every task requires an LLM; traditional tools remain valuable"

### Key Insight
Wealthsimple is heavily investing in AI for engineering productivity but their customer-facing AI is primarily used for support deflection (chatbot/voice), not for expanding what users can do. The planned AI research dashboard (via Fey acquisition) is their most ambitious customer-facing AI product but it's focused narrowly on stock research.
