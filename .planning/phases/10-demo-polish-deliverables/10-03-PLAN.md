<objective>
Write the complete demo video script — a scene-by-scene, second-by-second guide for recording the 2-3 minute demo video with Screen Studio. The script tells the story of a compliance officer using the AI orchestrator to process three cases, showing the full spectrum of AI capabilities and human judgment.

Purpose: The demo video is one of three deliverables for the Wealthsimple AI Builders submission. It must clearly demonstrate what the system does, how it helps compliance officers, and where the AI stops. A tight, well-scripted demo is the difference between "interesting project" and "this person understands the problem deeply."

Output: A detailed script document that the user can follow to record the demo video in one take.

    # Demo Video Script: KYC/AML Operations Orchestrator

    ## Recording Setup

    **Tool**: Screen Studio (macOS)
    **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (record at 2x on Retina, export at 1080p)
    **Browser**: Chrome or Arc, zoomed to 110% for readability
    **Settings**:
    - Screen Studio: Enable cursor highlighting, smooth cursor movement
    - Hide browser bookmarks bar
    - Close all other tabs
    - Use the production Vercel URL (not localhost)
    - Dark mode OFF (light theme for video clarity)
    - Disable all notifications/Do Not Disturb mode ON

    **Audio**: Record narration via Screen Studio built-in mic, or record separately and overlay. If recording separately, use a quiet room and speak slowly/clearly.

    **Export**: MP4, 1080p, 30fps, high quality. Target file size under 100MB.

    **Total duration target**: 2:00 - 2:30 (under 3 minutes)

    ---

    ## Pre-Recording Checklist

    - [ ] Production URL loaded and working
    - [ ] Demo data seeded (5 cases visible in queue)
    - [ ] Browser zoomed to 110%

    ## Script

    ### INTRO — The Problem (0:00 - 0:15)

    **Screen**: Browser open to the case queue dashboard, showing 5 cases with various statuses.

    **Narration**:
    "KYC compliance is one of the most time-consuming processes in financial services. A single case can take a compliance officer 4 to 5 hours — reading documents, screening sanctions lists, cross-referencing identities, and writing up a risk assessment. This AI orchestrator does it in under 3 minutes."

    **Actions**:
    - Start on the case queue view. Let the viewer see the 5 cases with their status badges (approved, escalated, review, review, processing).
    - Pause for 2 seconds so viewers can read the case list.

    ---

    ### SCENE 1 — Clean Case: The Fast Track (0:15 - 0:50)

    **Screen**: Click into Case 1 — Sarah Chen (approved, low risk).

    **Narration**:
    "Let's start with a straightforward case. Sarah Chen — Canadian citizen, opening an investment account. The AI orchestrator processed her application by running five specialized agents in parallel."

    **Actions**:
    - Click on Sarah Chen's case in the queue
    - The risk profile view loads showing risk score 12/100 (low risk, green)

    **Narration** (over the risk profile):
    "The Document Processor used Mistral OCR to extract data from her passport and utility bill — name, date of birth, address — all with 95% confidence. The Identity Verifier cross-referenced these fields and found zero discrepancies. The Sanctions Screener checked OFAC, UN, and PEP databases — no matches."

    **Actions**:
    - Scroll through or click on the agent results section showing each agent's status (all green/completed)
    - Hover over or expand the document processor results briefly
    - Show the sanctions screening results (no matches)

    **Narration**:
    "The Risk Scorer aggregated these signals into a composite score of 12 out of 100 — low risk. The Case Narrator generated a plain-English assessment. The compliance officer reviewed it, agreed, and approved in seconds."

    **Actions**:
    - Show the case narrative text
    - Show the decision section with "Approved" badge and the officer's justification
    - Show the audit trail briefly (list of timestamped actions)

    **Transition**: Click back to the case queue.

    ---

    ### SCENE 2 — Sanctions Catch: Where AI Shines (0:50 - 1:30)

    **Screen**: Click into Case 2 — Viktor Petrov (escalated, critical risk).

    **Narration**:
    "Now the interesting case. Viktor Petrov — the system flagged him immediately."

    **Actions**:
    - Click on Viktor Petrov's case
    - Risk score 87/100 loads with red/critical badge

    **Narration**:
    "The Sanctions Screener found a high-confidence match on the OFAC SDN list — a 94% name similarity score against a sanctioned individual in the SDGT program. This is exactly the kind of match that would take a human analyst 30 minutes to find in a database of 11,000 entries."

    **Actions**:
    - Show the sanctions screening results with the match highlighted
    - Show the match details: list name (OFAC SDN), match score (0.94), program (SDGT)

    **Narration**:
    "The Risk Scorer pushed this to 87 — critical. But here's the key: the AI doesn't make the call. It surfaces the evidence, scores the risk, and recommends escalation. The compliance officer reviewed the match, confirmed it warranted enhanced due diligence, and escalated to senior compliance. If an STR needs to be filed, that's a human decision — as required by FINTRAC regulations."

    **Actions**:
    - Show the case narrative warning about the sanctions match
    - Show the decision: "Escalated" with the officer's justification
    - Show audit trail showing the escalation chain
    - Brief pause on the STR-related audit entry

    **Transition**: Click back to the case queue.

    ---

    ### SCENE 3 — Edge Case: Where AI Stops (1:30 - 2:00)

    **Screen**: Click into Case 3 — Amara Okafor (in review, medium risk).

    **Narration**:
    "This case shows where AI knows its limits. Amara Okafor's driver's license came through with poor image quality — the OCR confidence dropped to 62%. And there's a name discrepancy between her license and utility bill."

    **Actions**:
    - Click on Amara Okafor's case
    - Show the medium risk score (45/100, yellow badge)
    - Show the document processor results with the low confidence score highlighted
    - Show the identity verifier results with the discrepancy flagged

    **Narration**:
    "No sanctions matches, identity is probably fine — it's just an abbreviated name on the utility bill. But the AI isn't confident enough to recommend approval. Instead, it flags the case for manual review and suggests requesting a clearer copy of the license. That's the right call — the human reviews the evidence, makes the judgment, and moves on."

    **Actions**:
    - Show the case narrative explaining the medium risk and the suggestion
    - Show that the decision section is empty — awaiting officer review
    - This case is NOT decided — it's waiting for human judgment

    ---

    ### OUTRO — The Value Proposition (2:00 - 2:20)

    **Screen**: Return to the case queue, showing all 5 cases.

    **Narration**:
    "Five cases. The AI orchestrator handles the cognitive drudgery — document processing, sanctions screening, risk scoring — in minutes instead of hours. The compliance officer reviews synthesized risk profiles with linked evidence, makes the judgment calls that regulations require, and moves on to the next case. That's the value: AI handles the analysis, humans make the decisions."

    **Actions**:
    - Show the full case queue one more time
    - Let the viewer see the mix of statuses: approved, escalated, review, review, processing
    - Optionally show Case 5 (processing) with agents mid-flight to demonstrate real-time visualization

    **End**: Pause 3 seconds on the case queue. Recording ends.

    ## Timing Summary

    | Scene | Duration | Running Total |
    |-------|----------|---------------|
    | Intro | 15s | 0:15 |
    | Scene 1: Clean Case | 35s | 0:50 |
    | Scene 2: Sanctions Catch | 40s | 1:30 |

    ## Key Talking Points to Hit

    - [ ] "5 days to 3 minutes" (intro)
    - [ ] "5 specialized agents running in parallel" (scene 1)
    - [ ] "95% confidence" on document extraction (scene 1)
    - [ ] "94% name similarity on OFAC SDN" (scene 2)
    - [ ] "AI doesn't make the call" (scene 2)
    - [ ] "STR filing is a human decision — FINTRAC requires it" (scene 2)
    - [ ] "62% OCR confidence — AI flags for manual review" (scene 3)
    - [ ] "AI handles the analysis, humans make the decisions" (outro)

    ## If Something Goes Wrong

    - **Page doesn't load**: Switch to localhost as backup. Have `npm run dev` ready.
    - **Demo data missing**: Run `npx tsx scripts/seed-demo-data.ts` and retry.
    - **Recording too long**: Cut Scene 3 shorter — the sanctions catch (Scene 2) is the money shot.
    - **Audio issues**: Record video first, add narration in post using Screen Studio's audio overlay.

    ## Post-Recording

    1. Review the recording in Screen Studio
    2. Trim any dead air or mistakes at start/end
    3. Add zoom effects on key moments (sanctions match, risk score) if time permits
    4. Export as MP4, 1080p, 30fps
    5. Watch the final export once to verify audio sync and readability
